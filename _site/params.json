  "body": "### First Steps.\r\n#### Service Account\r\nBefore you can run the Python scripts you'll need to set up a Service Account in GAFE. This is a robot account that your script will use to access Sheets. Any Sheet that you want your script to access will be shared with this Service Account.\r\n#### MySQL\r\nYou must also set up a MySQL database on the same server that the Python script will be running. I've included a script to that should take care of most of this part.\r\n\r\n### The Script\r\nWeâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRyan Aguilar @WrightESD\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with IterateEd-demo?
